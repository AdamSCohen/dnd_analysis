Project for Code Louisville Data Analytics 2 Course - Analysis of Spells from Dungeons & Dragons

The purpose of this project is to analyze various aspects of spells from the Dungeons & Dragons Tabletop Roleplaying Game. Primarily, this project was used as a way to learn and practice my coding skills. As I continue my education, I hope to return to this project to take a deeper look at the data and analyze it in more complex and interesting ways.

# Code Louisville Project Requirements
1. Loading data - Read TWO data sets in with an API.
2. Clean and operate on the data while combining them - Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.
3. Visualize / Present your data - Make 3 matplotlib visualizations to display your data.
4. Best practices - Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.
5. Interpretation of your data - Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.


# Running the project
1. Download this repo or clone `https://github.com/AdamSCohen/dnd_analysis.git`
2. It is recommended, but not required, to create and activate a virtual environment to run the program and not affect your current settings and installations.
3. Use pip to install required modules. The modules needed are `pandas` `numpy` `requests` and `matplotlib`, as well as Jupter Notebook.

`pip install notebook`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install requests`

`pip install matplotlib`

Alternatively, use pip to install the `requirements.txt`

Usually: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file `main.ipynb` in your prefered code editor. Visual Studio Code was used in the production of the project. Run all cells of the notebook.
